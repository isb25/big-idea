Program: 
Our 

What the program does:
So for all the confused people out there who are still trying to figure out what age bracet you fit this is for you, or even those of you who are curious by nature.

Step 1: It takes your name.

Step 2: It takes your age.

Step 3: It reads the entered value and tells you wether you are a toddler(highly unlikely you know what's going on here), young adult, teenager, adult, or if you have managed to live over a 100 years please tell us your secret.

Step 4: You are no longer the confused person you came into this program, you're welcome.

The end.
